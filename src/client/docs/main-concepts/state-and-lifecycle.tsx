import React from 'react';

/**
 * Notes:
 * - In applications with many components, itâ€™s very important to free up resources taken by the
 * components when they are destroyed. (For example here, setInterval)
 * - State can only be directly assigned in the constructor. Every other place we use setState.
 * - State and props update may be asynchronous (batched). User (state, props) => void function in
 * the setState method to update instead. This can be arrow or regular function.
 * - State updates are shallow merged.
 * - Date flows down (unidirections or top-down) - state is always local and owned by a specific
 * component, and any UI or component derived from that state can only affect components below them
 * in the tree.
